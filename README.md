## Welcome to Jia Li's Pages

It is 11:02pm March 02 when I was sitting down and stating typing. I looked at my two sleeping kids, and I asked myself why do I want to apply Ada.

It is THE **_Struggle_**.

   As a woman, I am eager to be finacially independent. Or in other words, I desire to share the fiancial burden on my guy. He was working on the his own startup for three years, a toy company. XXX. I am helping him with vendor sourcing, subcontractor communication and bookkeeping (bookkeeping certification obtain at Bellevue Community College).
   
  As a mom, sometimes, I ask myself what is going to happen if I have to raise kids by myself and how I can start my career. I moved to the States five years ago since my husband was tired of living in Shanghai, China. People said it is hard to begin a new career at their thirties, as I read from the former Ada students. To me, I think what is harder is to start your new life in another country with different culture at your thirties. 
  
  I majored in Egnlish when I was at college. Living in a country speaking Madarin, the ability of English is my advantage, while in the Sates, it turns to be a weakness. I could have spent another four years to get the second bachlor degree, but it is too long for me. When I was planning on 2-year-MBA and scored GMAT 710 (90%+), I was recommended by friends about Ada. An one year program is nothing but perfect for me. 
  
  I have been working for game companies for 6 years in Shanghai. I was exective administravtive. I am a highly organized and self driven individualal. Later, I was promoted to be XXX passionate, an accomplished communicator and a team player. I was the cofunder of a game studio. excellent organizational, decision making and time management skill. detail orietated , analytical and dynamic individual.
  
  I am looking forward to a chance.
