## Welcome to Jia Li's Pages

It is 11:02pm March 02 when I was sitting down and stating typing. I looked at my two sleeping kids, and I asked myself why do I want to apply Ada.

It is THE **_Struggle_**
  I moved to the States five years ago since my husband was tired of living in Shanghai, China. People said it is hard to get a new career at their thirties, as I read from the former Ada students. But, I think what is harder is to begin your new life in another country at your thirties. I majored in Egnlish when I was at college. Living in a country speaking Madarin, the ability of English is my advantage, while in the Sates, it turns to be a weakness.  It is too long for me to spend another four years to get the second bachlor degree. Without any recognized education background, I am stuck.
  
  As a mom, sometimes, I ask myself what is going to happen if I have to raise kids by myself. 
  As a woman, I am eager to be finacially independent. Or in other words, I desire to share the fiancial burden on my guy.
