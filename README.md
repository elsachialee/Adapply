## Welcome to Jia Li's Resume

#### _Before the Resume_

The resume doesn’t include the period from the end of 2014 to now, when I was intermittently working with my husband on our startup – [Bit toys]( http://www.bit-toys.com/) [Bit toys Twitter](https://twitter.com/bittoys?lang=en). 

Bit-toys used to focus on NFC toys on mobile games and currently is making adjustments and developing VR games. We also provide B2B game solutions as we produce the NFC tokens to Activison (sold out at the Game Shop). We developed the dinosaur NFC mobile game. Demo is available on the [Bit toys]( http://www.bit-toys.com/). I was in charge of factory vendors sourcing, the communication with Chinese subcontractors and helped with game design. My another role is the bookkeeper (bookkeeping certification acquired at Bellevue Community College).

I moved to the States five years ago since my husband was tired of living in Shanghai, China. I worked for game companies for 6 years in Shanghai. As an executive administrative, I am a highly organized and self-driven individual. The job of an assistant DM ensures my passionate, dynamic and analytical personality. I am an accomplished communicator and a good team player. I was the co-funder of a game outsourcing studio. My organizational ability, decision-making and time management skills are recognized by the team.

People said it is hard to begin a new career at 30’s, as I read from a former Ada student. To me, I think what is harder is to start a new life in another country with different culture at 30’s.  As a woman at the age of 35, I am eager to be independent. It means not only financially independent but psychologically. That's why I am not willing to work a fulltime job at Bit-toys. As a mom with two kids, I am supposed to be the role model of them, what is another reason I want to keep learning.  I will encourage them to be brave and prepared to meet the challenges in the life as I did for the new career life as an engineer. Living in a country speaking Mandarin, the ability of English is my advantage, while in the States, it turns to be a weakness. I could have been upset and nerves, but I ask myself to be strong and positive. 

I was planning on 2-year-MBA and scored GMAT 710 (90%+), but I want to try Ada as the priority since I am interested in this program and I think I am a qualified candidate. 

Appreciated your time.
